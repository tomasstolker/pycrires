*pycrires* is a Python wrapper for running the CRIRES+ recipes of *EsoRex*.

The pipeline organizes the raw data, creates SOF and configuration files for *EsoRex*, runs the calibration and science recipes, improves the wavelength solution, and creates plots of the images and extracted spectra.

Additionally, there are dedicated routines for the extraction, calibration, and detection of spatially-resolved objects such as directly imaged planets.

For spatially resolved objects, the telluric lines can typically be corrected with the stellar spectrum. Otherwise, it is possible to use an empirical modeling approach with the recipes of *MolecFit*. The pipeline interface of *pycrires* provides functionalities for both cases.
